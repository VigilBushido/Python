The good will is the only good without qualification.
The class of actions in accordance with duty must be distinguished from 
the class of actions performed from duty.

Kant believes only actions performed from duty have moral worth. 
He almost seems to suggest that the greater one's disinclination 
to act from duty, the greater the result of the moral worth of the action.

If one performs an action by inclination alone, then Kant 
implies the action has no moral worth.
